      can open up. He is involved with Reevaluation Counseling, which is a form
      of peer counseling.
    </p>

    <h3>Exercising</h3>
    <p>
      Jon works out at the gym, and listens to classical music between sets or
      allows his mind to wander. Sometimes he listens to audiobooks. He's slowly
      making his way through Thomas Khun's "<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions"
        target="_blank"
        >The Structure of Scientific Revolution</a

    <h3>Awareness</h3>
    <p>
      "Self-awareness allows one to discover the capacity to persevere through
      challenges. Lack thereof causes suffering."
    </p>

    <h3>Authenticity</h3>
    <p>
      "When authentic, one is capable of reaching out to others and making true
      connection. Authenticy is born of awareness, for when one realizes that
      most habituated defenses are unwarranted for any given situation, one can
      relax into being authentic. Constricted awareness causes rigid,
      repetitive, behaviors and attitudes that do not express the expansiveness
      of the heart."
    </p>

    <h3>Love</h3>
    <p>
      "Caring and affection are perhaps the most fulfilling emotions. Through
      caring one learns to expand into something more than oneself."
    </p>

    <h3>Healing</h3>
    <p>
      "Processing stress enables one to think with clarity, unpolarized by
      reactivity."
    </p>

    <h3>Seeking Truth</h3>
    <p>
      "Seeking truth requires independence of thought. To become an independent
      thinker, one needs to learn to trust in one's ability to make wise
      decisions. Financial independence is also valuable in allowing one the
      economic freedom to think independently."
    </p>

    <h3>Family</h3>
    <p>
      "One of the strongest ways that love is expressed is though family bonds.
      The care that one receives and gives in a family context can drive one's
      growth as a person."

    <h2 id="metaphysical">Metaphysical Beliefs</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Interconnectedness</h3>
    <p>
      "I believe that there is a fundamental interconnectedness between all;
      nothing exists in absolute isolation from the whole (Spinoza). This
      interconnectedness allows for the possibility of events influencing on
      other events, even when no concrete connection between them is perceived."
    </p>

    <h3>Events</h3>
    <p>
      "I like Alfred North Whitehead's
      <a
        href="http://www.angelfire.com/md2/timewarp/whitehead.html"
        target="_blank"
        >"Process Philosophy"</a
      >
      that states that there are only events; there is no concrete material.
      What appears to be material are highly patterned events that have become
      so cyclical that they appear concrete."
    </p>

    <h3>Mentation</h3>
    <p>
      "I like Alfred North Whiteheads's theory of mind and body that states that
      mentation is not categorically distinct from the physical (contra
      Descarte's dichotomy). Both mentation and the physical are events of an
      organic universe (contra contemporary physicalists) whose only constant
      factors are <emph>creativity</emph> and <emph>entropy</emph> (Rupert
      Sheldrake,
      <a
        href="https://www.amazon.com/Science-Set-Free-Paths-Discovery/dp/0770436722"
        target="_blank"
        >"Science Set Free"</a
      >, base on A.N. Whitehead, above)."
    </p>

    <h3>Decisions</h3>
    <p>
      "I believe that every decision sets a force toward its actuation into
      motion, and influences the decider's psychic constitution, and the psychic
      constitution of the decider's direct descendents. Thus, through decisions,
      one contributes to the development of one's evolutionary trajectory."
