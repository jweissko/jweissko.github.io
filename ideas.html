      smoothly.
    </p>

    <h3>Connecting</h3>
    <p>
      Jon likes connecting with people. He is involved with Reevaluation
      Counseling, which is a form of peer counseling.
    </p>

    <h3>Exercising</h3>
    <p>
      Jon works out at the gym, and sometimes listens to audiobooks between
      sets. He's painstakingly making his way through Thomas Khun's "<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions"
        target="_blank"
        >The Structure of Scientific Revolution</a

      Jon likes baking whole-grain sourdough breads on weekends. He uses
      home-ground Kamut, rye, spelt, oats and rice flour. He likes its earthy
      taste!

    <h3>Awareness</h3>
    <p>
      "Self-awareness allows one to discover the capacity to persevere through
      challenges. Lack thereof causes suffering."
    </p>

    <h3>Authenticity</h3>
    <p>
      "Authenticy is born of awareness, for when one realizes that most
      habituated defenses are unwarranted, one can relax them and be
      self-revealing. Constricted awareness causes rigid, repetitive behaviors
      that do not express the expansiveness of the heart."
    </p>

    <h3>Love</h3>
    <p>
      "Caring and affection are perhaps the most fulfilling emotions. Through
      caring one learns to expand into something more than oneself."
    </p>

    <h3>Healing</h3>
    <p>
      "Processing stress allows one to make decisions unpolarized by
      reactivity."
    </p>

    <h3>Seeking Truth</h3>
    <p>
      "Seeking truth requires independent thinking. To become an independent
      thinker, one needs to learn to trust in one's ability to make wise
      decisions."
    </p>

    <h3>Family</h3>
    <p>
      "One of the strongest ways to express love is though family bonds. Caring
      that one receives and gives in a family context drives one's growth as a
      person."
    </p>

    <h2 id="metaphysical">Metaphysical Beliefs</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Interconnectedness</h3>
    <p>
      "Nothing exists in absolute isolation from the whole (Spinoza)."
    </p>

    <h3>Events</h3>
    <p>
      "Alfred North Whitehead's
      <a
        href="http://www.angelfire.com/md2/timewarp/whitehead.html"
        target="_blank"
        >"Process Philosophy"</a
      >
      posits that there are only events; there is no concrete material. What
      appears to be material is in actuality highly patterned events that have
      become so cyclical that they appear concrete."
    </p>

    <h3>Mentation</h3>
    <p>
      "Alfred North Whiteheads's theory of mind and body posits that both
      mentation and the physical are events of an organic universe (contra
      contemporary physicalists) whose only constant forces are
      <emph>creativity</emph> and <emph>entropy</emph> (Rupert Sheldrake,
      <a
        href="https://www.amazon.com/Science-Set-Free-Paths-Discovery/dp/0770436722"
        target="_blank"
        >"Science Set Free"</a
      >, based on A.N. Whitehead, above)."
    </p>

    <h3>Decisions</h3>
    <p>
      "Every decision sets a force into motion towards its actuation, and alters
      the decider's psychic constitution. Through decisions, one participates in
      one's evolutionary trajectory."
