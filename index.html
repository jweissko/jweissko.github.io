        <h3>Background</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Hailing from Boston MA, Jonathan has taken what you might call the "round-about" route in life. After years of traditional Jewish learning, he set out to begin his career in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/100008193365328/posts/1625291234420640/" target="_blank">rabbinics</a>, only to discover that religion, as he had learned it, wasn't for him. So he made a 180, and attempted an <a href="https://jonathanlifecoaching.weebly.com/testimonials.html" target="_blank">entrepreneurial adventure</a> as a life coach, and then came to Brown University for a second bachelors degree. He settled on computer science at the start of his sophomore year.</p> 
        
        <h3>Current Work</h3>
        <hr>
        <p> Due to a crazy turn of events and some very good fortune, he now is Head Teaching Assistant for <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1270/" target="_blank" >CS1270: Database Management Systems</a>, under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Zdonik" target="_blank">Professor Stan Zdonik</a>. While the course needed an enourmous amount of work, he is proud to say that it seems that students are taking away a deeper understanding of databases this year than his own cohort did last year. He is taking CS6 to brush up on systems skills, but he is always behind in CS6 assignments, due to his overwhelming HTA'ing commitments. </p> 
        
        <h3>Future</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Jonathan hopes to work as a software engineer after graduation; at least that is the current plan. He enjoys working with all things databases. Ideally, he'd like to find love, settle down, and have a family. </p>
