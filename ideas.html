    <h2 id="metaphysical">Metaphysical Beliefs</h2>
    <h3>Interconnectedness</h3>
    <p>I believe that there is a fundamental interconnectedness between all, and nothing exists in true isolation from the whole. This interconnectedness allows for the possibility of events influencing the course of the universe in ways that do not have a presently-known physical explanation. (Spinoza)</p>
    
    <h3>Events</h3>
    <p>I believe that there are only events, and there is no actual material. What appears to be material is merely highly patterned events that have become so cyclical and habituated, that they give off an appearance of concreteness (Alfred North Whitehead, <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/md2/timewarp/whitehead.html" target="_blank">"Process and Reality"</a>.)</p>
    
    <h3>Mentation</h3>
    <p>I believe that mentation is not categorically distinct from the physical (and I thereby reject Descarte's dichotomy of mind and body). They are both events of an organic universe (contrary to contemporary physicalists) who's only constant factors are the forces of creativity and entropy (Rupert Sheldrake, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Science-Set-Free-Paths-Discovery/dp/0770436722" target="_blank">"Science Set Free"</a>, base on A.N. Whitehead, above).</p>
    
    <h3>Decisions</h3>
    <p>I believe that every decision sets a force of creativity into motion, and influences the decider's psychological constitution, and the psychological constitution of the decider's descendents, like a wave made in a distant place in the ocean that travels thousands of miles to land.</p>

    <h3>Awareness</h3>
    <p>One who is self-aware can generally discover within themselves the capacity to persevere. Lack of self awareness is the main cause of suffering.</p>
    
    <h3>Authenticity</h3>
    <p>Authenticy is a product of awareness, for when one is aware, one realizes there is no need for emotional defenses, and can relax into being authentic. When authentic, one is capable of reaching out to others and making true connection.</p>
    
    <h3>Love</h3>
    <p>Caring and affection are perhaps the most meaningful emotions that a person can feel. Through caring and love we learn to expand into something more than ourselves.</p>
    
    <h3>Healing</h3>
    <p>Processing emotions and stress are what enable a person to garner the resolve to become a more loving individual. It is important to work though emotions to try to heal, and seek out help when necessary.</p>
    
    <h3>Independence</h3>
    <p>To have the freedom to discover oneself, one needs an independent mind. This is achieved by cultivating clarity of thought to the degree that one can trust one's own thinking. Also, it can be very difficult to think independently when you are financially beholden to family  or others who want you to believe a certain way. Therefore, financial independence is also important in allowing oneself the freedom to think independently.</p>
         
    <h3>Family</h3>
    <p>Having, or being a part of a family is very valuable, since one of the strongest ways that love is expressed is though family bonds, and the care that one receives and gives in a family context can strongly drive your growth as a person.</p>

    <h3>Coding</h3>
    <p>I like coding. Seeing how all the parts come together is exciting and fulfills technical drive.</p>
    
    <h3>Connecting</h3>
    <p>I like connecting with people. Learning about others and listening to their stories feels meaningful. I also like creating a context in which others can open up without fear of judgement.</p>
         
    <h3>Counseling</h3>
    <p>I am involved with Reevaluation Counseling, which is a form of peer counseling. It helps me to continue to grow in the ways that I mentioned above.</p>
         
    <h3>Exercising</h3>
    <p>I like working out! I go the gym regularly, and listen to classical music between sets or just allow my mind to wander. Sometimes I listen to audiobooks. I'm gradually making my way through Thomas Khun's "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions" target="_blank">The Structure of Scientific Revolution</a>."</p>
         
    <h3>Baking Bread</h3>
    <p>I like baking whole grain sourdough bread on weekends during school breaks. It tastes delicious, is healthy, and my family enjoys it!</p>
