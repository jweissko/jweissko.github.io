    <h3>Background</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Hailing from Boston, Massachusetts, Jon spent years after high school
      pursuing traditional Jewish learning, and set out to begin his career in
      <a
        href="https://www.facebook.com/100008193365328/posts/1625291234420640/"
        target="_blank"
        >rabbinics</a
      >, but felt that his views had grown to be too universalistic to follow a
      particular belief doctrine. So he made a 180, and attempted an
      <a

        target="_blank"
        >entrepreneurial adventure</a
      >
      as a life coach, and then came to Brown University for a second bachelors
      degree. He settled on computer science at the start of his sophomore year.
    </p>

    <h3>Current Work</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Jon has had the good fortune of serving as Head Teaching Assistant for
      <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1270/" target="_blank"
        >CS1270: Database Management Systems</a
      >
      at Brown University, under
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Zdonik" target="_blank"
        >Professor Stan Zdonik</a
      >
      this past Fall semester (2019). While the course content needed an
      enourmous amount of work, he is proud to report that the students are
      taking away from the course a deeper understanding of databases this year
      than his own cohort did the year before. He looks forward to continuing to
      serve as a Teaching Assistant at Brown University next semester, for the
      course
      <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1951-a/" target="_blank"
        >CS1951A: Data Science</a
      >.
    </p>

    <h3>Future</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Jon hopes to work as a software engineer after his graduation. He enjoys
      working with all things databases.
